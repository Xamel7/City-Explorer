**Author**: Joel Meadows
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Navigation: One of the main challenges of city exploration is navigating through a new and unfamiliar environment. This may involve finding your way around on foot, using public transportation, or driving. You'll need to be able to read maps and use GPS systems effectively, as well as understand the local traffic laws and regulations.

Discovery: City exploration is all about discovering new and interesting places and experiences. This may involve visiting popular tourist attractions, exploring hidden neighborhoods and backstreets, trying local cuisine, or attending cultural events.

Safety: When exploring a new city, safety is always a concern. You'll need to be aware of your surroundings and take precautions to ensure your safety, such as avoiding dangerous neighborhoods and taking care with your belongings.

Culture and History: Understanding the culture and history of a city is essential for a meaningful exploration experience. This may involve visiting museums, historical sites, or attending cultural events.

Logistics: There are also many logistical challenges involved in city exploration, such as finding accommodation, managing transportation, and staying within a budget. You'll need to be able to plan and organize your trip effectively to make the most of your time and resources.
## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Set up your development environment: Before you can start building your app, you'll need to set up your development environment. This will involve installing Node.js and a code editor such as Visual Studio Code.

Create a new React project: Use the create-react-app tool to create a new React project. Open your command prompt or terminal and enter the following command: npx create-react-app my-city-explorer-app

Install necessary dependencies: Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory and install any necessary dependencies using the command: npm install

Plan and design your app: Before you start coding, plan and design your app by creating a wireframe or mockup of the user interface. Determine the features and functionality you want to include in your app and how they will be organized.

Set up your components: In React, you will use components to build your app's user interface. Start by creating the necessary components for your app, such as a navigation bar, a map component, a list of attractions, or a search bar.

Write your code: Once your components are set up, start writing the code to implement your app's functionality. Use React to handle user input, fetch data from APIs, and update the UI dynamically.

Test and debug your app: Test your app to ensure that it works as expected and debug any errors or issues that arise.

Deploy your app: Once your app is complete, deploy it to a web server or hosting platform such as Heroku or Netlify to make it accessible to users.

Maintain and update your app: As your app grows and evolves, continue to maintain and update it to ensure that it remains functional and relevant to users.

## Architecture
